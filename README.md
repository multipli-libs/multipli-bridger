Some FAQs
- Why are we not using Openzeppeling contracts directly?
These contracts are already deployed and live, so we're using the exact code that's live in production.

- Why can't we improve the file organisation? 
This contract was written about couple of years ago when we didn't know better so the file organisation is a bit all over the place. We intend to release a new contract version that addresses most of the issues in the present one while adding more features to the contract.
